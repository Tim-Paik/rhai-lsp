//! # Rhai - embedded scripting for Rust
//!
//! ![Rhai logo](https://rhai.rs/book/images/logo/rhai-banner-transparent-colour.svg)
//!
//! Rhai is a tiny, simple and fast embedded scripting language for Rust
//! that gives you a safe and easy way to add scripting to your applications.
//!
//! It provides a familiar syntax based on JavaScript+Rust and a simple Rust interface.
//!
//! # A Quick Example
//!
//! ## Contents of `my_script.rhai`
//!
//! ```ignore
//! /// Brute force factorial function
//! fn factorial(x) {
//!     if x == 1 { return 1; }
//!     x * factorial(x - 1)
//! }
//!
//! // Calling an external function 'compute'
//! compute(factorial(10))
//! ```
//!
//! ## The Rust part
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use rhai::{Engine, EvalAltResult};
//!
//! fn main() -> Result<(), Box<EvalAltResult>>
//! {
//!     // Define external function
//!     fn compute_something(x: i64) -> bool {
//!         (x % 40) == 0
//!     }
//!
//!     // Create scripting engine
//!     let mut engine = Engine::new();
//!
//!     // Register external function as 'compute'
//!     engine.register_fn("compute", compute_something);
//!
//! #   #[cfg(not(feature = "no_std"))]
//! #   #[cfg(not(any(target_arch = "wasm32", target_arch = "wasm64")))]
//!     assert_eq!(
//!         // Evaluate the script, expects a 'bool' return
//!         engine.eval_file::<bool>("my_script.rhai".into())?,
//!         true
//!     );
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Documentation
//!
//! See [The Rhai Book](https://rhai.rs/book) for details on the Rhai scripting engine and language.
